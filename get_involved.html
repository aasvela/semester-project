                        <h4>Volunter</h4>
                        <p>
                            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
