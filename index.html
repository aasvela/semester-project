                            Over the course of human history, science has developed from 
                            our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth 
                            to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very 
                            building blocks of life itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone
                            can experience the wonders of our discoveries 
                            and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue 
                            the exploration of the world around us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook,
                            but brought to live through exhibits. 
                            This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on 
                            the many varied subjects of science to explore.
                            Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact 
                            with and play around to see science come to life 
                            (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night
                            when everyone’s gone home).
